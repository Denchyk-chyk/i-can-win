In my hour of need
Heh, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold, very cold
No one cares for me

Did you ever think I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think to stop thinking
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too

Things will be better
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you, I'm probably wrong
